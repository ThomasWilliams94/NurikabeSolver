# NurikabeSolver
This solves a Nurikabe puzzle for you. 

At present, this is a console application, while I develop the solver code. 

I aim to turn it into a Windows Form application (mainly to improve ease of 
input), and perhaps eventually even into a game for users to try and solve
the puzzle, which it will then check and feedback to you. 

I am trying to structure everything in a clear way but have no formal teaching 
in computer science. All self-taught!

If you are interested in the project, I would be very grateful for any feedback 
you may have.
